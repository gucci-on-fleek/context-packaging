ConTeXt Non-free Files
======================

The [ConTeXt Standalone
Distribution](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Introduction/Installation)
contains a few files that may be redistributed free-of-charge, but do
not [qualify as free (libre) software as per the TeX Live
guidelines](https://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html). These files are
not required for a functioning ConTeXt installation, and as such, they
have been removed from the main TeX Live ConTeXt package (`context`).

Most of these files are support files for non-free fonts; the remainder
of the files have licenses preventing modification. It would be prudent
to verify the licenses for each individual file before redistributing
them or using them commercially, although as far as I'm aware, this is
permitted for all files included here.

All of these files are available in the `context-nonfree` package
available from either [TLContrib](https://contrib.texlive.info/) or from
the [TDS-compliant archive `context-nonfree.zip` on
CTAN][context-nonfree.zip], so they may be easily installed into your
TeX Live installation should you choose to do so.
