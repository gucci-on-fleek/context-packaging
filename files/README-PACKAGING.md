ConTeXt Packaging
=================

ConTeXt is officially distributed as part of the [ConTeXt Standalone
Distribution](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Introduction/Installation);
this project exists to package ConTeXt into
[TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html) and
[CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/context). For more information, please
see [the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gucci-on-fleek/context-packaging).

Note that this project only packages the newer MkIV (LuaTeX) and MkXL
(LuaMetaTeX) formats; the legacy MkII (pdfTeX and XeTeX) formats are
packaged by the TeX Live maintainers directly.


Support
-------

If you have a problem with ConTeXt itself, it is best to report it to
the official
[`ntg-context@ntg.nl`](https://mailman.ntg.nl/archives/list/ntg-context@ntg.nl/latest)
mailing list.

If you notice that ConTeXt is mispackaged in TeX Live or CTAN, then
please [open a new issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/gucci-on-fleek/context-packaging/issues/new),
email the public
[`ntg-context@ntg.nl`](https://mailman.ntg.nl/archives/list/ntg-context@ntg.nl/latest)
or [`tex-live@tug.org`](https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-live)
mailing lists, or email me privately at `tex@maxchernoff.ca`. [Pull
requests](https://github.com/gucci-on-fleek/context-packaging/compare)
are also gladly accepted.
